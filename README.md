# Challenge-13

In challenge 13 we try to predict the success of startups from the help of Alphabet Soup and its gift of venture funding. We use a csv file with over 30,000 entries of data to teach our model and give it the best chance to successfully predict the future of other startups.

## Results 

At the end of the assignment you will see the outcome of three different models used throughout the project:

***Original***
- Accuracy: 73.06%
- Loss: 0.5603

***Alternative Model 1***
- Accuracy: 72.96%
- Loss: 0.5676

***Alternative Model 2***
- Accuracy: 73.01%
- Loss: 0.5594

In the end, the original model was the most accurate while the second alternative model lost the least. The first alternative model was the least effective in terms of loss and accuracy and would not be recommended for further use.
